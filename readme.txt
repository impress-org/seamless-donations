Seamless Donations is so easy to install and configure that your Web site can accept donations via your PayPal account within five minutes of downloading the plugin.

**Seamless Donations is free and will never, ever charge you a commission.**

Learn more on the [Seamless Donations home page](http://zatzlabs.com/project/seamless-donations/).

= Automatic Repeating Donations =

You can instantly give your donors the option to make their donation repeat automatically. You can turn on on the option with a click, which gives your donors a checkbox to make any donation repeat.

= Here are some of the major features added in 4.0 =

* **Updated, modern admin UI:** The admin interface has been updated to a modern tabbed-look.
* **Custom post types:** Funds and donors have now been implemented as custom post types. This gives you the ability to use all of WordPress’ post management and display tools with donors and funds. The donation data has always been a custom post type, but it is now also available to manipulate using
plugins and themes outside of Seamless Donations.
* **Designed for extensibility:** The primary design goal of 4.0 was to add hooks in the form of filters and actions that web designers can use to modify the behavior of Seamless Donations to fit individual needs. The plugin was re-architected to allow for loads of extensibility.
* **Forms engine designed for extensibility:** Rather than just basic form code, Seamless Donations 4.0 now has a brand-new array-driven forms engine, which will give web site builders the ability to modify and access every part of the form before it is displayed to donors.
* **Shortcode engine designed for extensibility:** The main shortcode for the plugin has been designed so that extensions can add features to the main seamless-donations shortcode.
* **Admin UI designed for extensibility:** Yep, like everything else, the admin interface has been designed to allow for extensibility.
* **Translation-ready:** Seamless Donations 4.0 has had numerous tweaks to allow it to be translated into other languages.

= Open Source, Extensible, and Developer-Friendly =

Seamless Donations 4.0 was designed from the ground up to be developer-friendly. Here are some of the developer resources you might find useful:

= Be sure to test for the following changes in the new version =
* **Change the form shortcode:** The [dgx-donate] shortcode is deprecated and will issue an update warning once you update. The new shortcode is [seamless-donations].
* **Check your CSS:** Most of the CSS should remain the same, but because the form interaction has been updated, your CSS may change.
* **Check your data:** Great pains have been taken to be sure the data migrates correctly, but please, please, PLEASE double-check it.
